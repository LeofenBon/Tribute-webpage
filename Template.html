	<div class="text1">It has been a week since I started learning computer programming and front end development. My prior knowledge in the field of computer science was scanty and I was nothing but a novice layman in this world. The motivation to embark this journey was a need to work on a creative idea of developing a social networking website and also a restless desire to do something bigger than myself. **Write whatever you want to here** There are days when I constantly go through the cycle of hopelessness and hopefulness, intimidated by the grand knowledge that lays there. However, the moments of tiny successes when I learn how "bootstrap CSS" works and when I fix something that is not working in my program magically erases the suffering and meandering dark clouds. When the tutorials that were no different than gibberish start to make sense and when the answers to "How is that going to function" start to appear, I find myself heading one step towards my goals.</div>

	<div class="text2">The road to self learning is a tough one. The road to self learning computer programs is a tougher one But, the online community of developers and coders has made the process of self-teaching such a great possibility and the whole process is so beautiful.  The online ecosystem of developers is a living example of “When one truly learns, they always want to return”. The creators and developers of web have not just made internet a wrench to turn the world around but have also simultaneously managed to create a sustainable environment for anyone who is willing to contribute to this world. Like every common person, I was unaware of this immense availability of resource until I tapped into this world. In today’s world, anyone who can understand English and has a working computer can learn how to code and not just learn to code but also innovate. The whole world shouts out to us to join the ride and it is not because there is a requirement of developers and coders but because they wouldn’t want you to miss any of it; the world going through a technological liberation and a chance to witness it from your own eyes. It is the first time ever in history of human existence, the availability of technological understanding and empowerment has been so possible and, I believe, anyone who is missing any of it is really missing a great part of human evolution. This webpage is a tribute to everyone who is onboard and making the web possible, to anyone who is innovating, to those who create dozens of coded libraries only to give away to the community to be used by anyone from the world. The debt of learning how to create computer programs is too big and it is my first attempt to give it back to the community as a token of appreciation.  On my ongoing journey of learning things, first few days were quite overwhelming. It was until I found the <a href=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02> article </a> posted on <a href=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/> FreeCodeCamp’s Cpmmunity </a> about detailed steps to attain Front-end Skills. I was already watching free tutorials on <a href=http://codecademy.com/> CodeCademy </a>. I still feel very appreciative towards <a href=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@JonathanZWhite> Jonathan Z. White </a> who wrote the article that kept me going and pointed towards the direction that was right. I also started taking lessons from <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/> FreeCodeCamp </a> and that boosted my knowledge and understanding of HTML and CSS. It really adds to a certain amount of delight to my heart that we, as a species, have successfully managed to, a significant extent, create an ecosystem where knowledge is shared and is not restricted to anybody. This is exactly the freedom and liberation that we need</div>

	<div class="text3">The website is designed using grid property of CSS, however, there are no visible rows and columns displaying grid-like structure in the page. The columns are used to define the margins of the page.  I had learned how to incorporate Bootstrap CSS on my web-page development skills and that was when I learned about CSS grid and started watching videos on YouTube about CSS grid. Learning how to use CSS grid added another milestone to the learning helping me understand the usage CSS to design websites.The page is made as a part of grid with three columns and rows stacked one above the other. The middle column is the prominent one that contains majority of the content. There are some elements that are spread all over the width of the webpage wherein all the columns are merged in one using the &quotgrid-row-column&quot property of the CSS.  Here is an illustration showing actual structure of the website. The illustration is itself made using CSS and same grid-structure used to make the page.
